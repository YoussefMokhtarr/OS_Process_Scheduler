Process Scheduler Using C (Fall 2021). The project goal is to implement a simulation imitating the OS process scheduler for a single CPU. The user chooses the algorithm and gives the scheduler a text file containing all the processes, their arrival times, their running times, and their priorities. The scheduler gives the user a text file containing some statistics as an output. The project was conducted using C in a team of 4 members.
